Add the word **hello** after the second line: 
```bash
$ seq 3 | sed '2a hello'
1
2
hello
3
```
Replace the 2nd to 9th lines with the word hello:
```bash
$ seq 10 | sed '2,9c hello'
1
hello
10
```
Delete the second input line: 
```bash
$ seq 3 | sed 2d
1
3
```
Insert the word ‘**hello**’ before the second line:
```bash
$ seq 3 | sed '2i hello'
1
hello
2
3
```
Reads file filename: 
```bash
$ seq 3 | sed '2r/etc/hostname'
1
2
fencepost.gnu.org
3
```
Insert the word ‘**hello**’ before the second line:
```bash
$ seq 3 | sed '2i hello'

The s command (as in substitute) is probably the most important in sed and has a lot of different options. 
The syntax of the s command is "**s/regexp/replacement/flags**"
```bash
$ sed -i 's/erors/errors/g' input.txt
```
Its basic concept is simple: the s command attempts to match the pattern space against the supplied regular expression regexp; if the match is successful, then that portion of the pattern space which was matched is replaced with replacement.

The replacement can contain \n (n being a number from 1 to 9, inclusive) references, which refer to the portion of the match which is contained between the nth anditsmatching.

Also, the replacement can contain unescaped **&** characters which reference the whole matched portion of the pattern space.

Commonly used flags are:

- g - apply the replacement to all matches to the regexp, not just the first.
- i - the i modifier to regular-expression matching is a GNU extension which makes sed match regexp in a case-insensitive manner.

Replace bash login shell with false for all users:
```bash
$ sudo sed -i 's/bash/false/g' /etc/passwd
```
Set bash login shell back only for vagrant user:
```bash
$ sudo sed -i '/vagrant/s/false/bash/g' /etc/passwd
```
