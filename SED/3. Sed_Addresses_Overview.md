## Sed Addresses Overview

### SED Addresses Overview
Addresses determine on which line(s) the sed command will be executed.

The following command replaces the word hello with world only on line 144: 
```bash
$ sed '144s/hello/world/' input.txt > output.txt
```
If no addresses are given, the command is performed on all lines.

The following command replaces the word **hello** with **world** on all lines in the input file: 
```bash
$ sed 's/hello/world/' input.txt > output.txt
```
Addresses can contain regular expressions to match lines based on content instead of line numbers.

The following command replaces the word ‘**hello**’ with ‘**world**’ only in lines containing the word ‘apple’: 
```bash
$ sed '/apple/s/hello/world/' input.txt > output.txt
```
### /regexp/

This will select any line which matches the regular expression regexp. If regexp itself includes any / characters, each must be escaped by a backslash (\).

### \%regexp%

(The % may be replaced by any other single character.) 

This also matches the regular expression regexp, but allows one to use a different delimiter than /. This is particularly useful if the regexp itself contains a lot of slashes, since it avoids the tedious escaping of every /. If regexp itself includes any delimiter characters, each must be escaped by a backslash (\). 
```bash
$ sed -n '/^\/home\/alice\/documents\//p'
$ sed -n '\%^/home/alice/documents/%p'
$ sed -n '\;^/home/alice/documents/;p'
```
Appending the ! character to the end of an address specification (before the command letter) negates the sense of the match.
That is, if the ! character follows an address or an address range, then only lines which **do not match** the addresses will be selected.

The following command replaces the word **hello** with **world** only in lines not containing the word **app** <=:
```bash
$ sed '/apple/!s/hello/world/' input.txt > output.txt
```
