## Sed Script Overview

### SED Script Overview

A sed program consists of one or more sed commands, passed in by one or more of the -e, -f, --expression, and --file options, or the first non-option argument if zero of these options are used.

Sed commands follow this syntax: [addr]X[options]:

- [addr] is an optional line address. If [addr] is specified, the command X will be executed only on the matched lines. [addr] can be a single line number, a regular expression, or a range of lines.
- X is a single-letter sed command.
- Additional [options] are used for some sed commands.

The following script deletes lines 30 to 35 in the input. 30,35 is an address range. d is the delete command:
```bash
$ sed '30,35d' input.txt > output.txt
```
The following script deletes any lines matching the regular expression /^foo/. Address range here is /^foo/.
```bash
$ sed '/^foo/d' input.txt > output.txt
```
Commands within a script or script-file can be separated by semicolons (;) or newlines. 

The following example performs two sed operations: deleting any lines matching the regular expression **/^foo/**, and replacing all occurrences of the string **hello** with **world**:
```bash
$ sed '/^foo/d; s/hello/world/' input.txt > output.txt
```
NOTE: commands **a**, **c**, **i**, due to their syntax, cannot be followed by semicolons working as command separators and thus should be terminated with newlines or be placed at the end of a **script** or **script-file**.
