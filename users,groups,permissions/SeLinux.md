## SELinux
### SELinux modes

Security Enhanced Linux or SELinux is an advanced access control mechanism built into most modern Linux distributions. SELinux implements what’s known as MAC (Mandatory Access Control). This is implemented on top of what’s already present in every Linux distribution, the DAC (Discretionary Access Control). At any one time, SELinux can be in any of three possible modes:

- Enforcing
- Permissive
- Disabled

In enforcing mode SELinux will enforce its policy on the Linux system and make sure any unauthorized access attempts by users and processes are denied. The access denials are also written to relevant log files. We will talk about SELinux policies and audit logs later.

Permissive mode is like a semi-enabled state. SELinux doesn’t apply its policy in permissive mode, so no access is denied. However any policy violation is still logged in the audit logs. It’s a great way to test SELinux before enforcing it.

The disabled mode is self-explanatory – the system won’t be running with enhanced security.

We can run the getenforce command to check the current SELinux mode.
```bash
# getenforce
```
SELinux should currently be disabled, so the output will look like this:
```bash
Disabled
```
We can also run the sestatus command:
```bash
# sestatus
```
When SELinux is disabled the output will show:
```bash
SELinux status:        disabled
```
### SELinux Configuration File

The main configuration file for SELinux is **/etc/selinux/config**. We can run the following command to view its contents:
```bash
$ cat /etc/selinux/config
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=disabled
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these two values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected. 
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
```
### Enabling and Disabling SELinux

**Enable**
```bash
$ vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux
…
SELINUX=permissive
…
$ reboot
$ vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux file:
…
SELINUX=enforcing
…
$reboot
```
**Disable**
```bash
$ vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux
…
SELINUX=disabled
…
$ reboot
```
### Policies

**List the SELinux policy modules currently loaded into memory**
```bash
$ semodule -l | less
abrt    1.2.0
accountsd       1.0.6
acct    1.5.1
afs     1.8.2
aiccu   1.0.2
aide    1.6.1
ajaxterm        1.0.0
alsa    1.11.4
amanda  1.14.2
amtu    1.2.3
anaconda        1.6.1
antivirus       1.0.0
apache  2.4.0
```
**Changing SELinux Boolean Settings**
```bash
$ semanage boolean -l | less
ftp_home_dir                   (off  ,  off)  Allow ftp to home dir
