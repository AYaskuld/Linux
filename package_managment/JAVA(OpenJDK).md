## JAVA (OpenJDK)

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is an implementation of either one of the:

        Java Platform, Standard Edition,
        Java Platform, Enterprise Edition, or
        Java Platform, Micro Edition platforms

released by Oracle Corporation in the form of a binary product aimed at Java developers on Solaris, Linux, macOS or Windows. The JDK includes a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources to finish the development of a Java Application.

Since the introduction of the Java platform, it has been by far the most widely used Software Development Kit (SDK). On 17 November 2006, Sun announced that they would release it under the GNU General Public License (GPL), thus making it free software. This happened in large part on 8 May 2007, when Sun contributed the source code to the OpenJDK.
```bash
# OpenJDK installation
apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```
