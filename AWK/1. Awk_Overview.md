## Awk Overview

The basic function of awk is to search files for lines (or other units of text) that contain certain patterns. When a line matches one of the patterns, awk performs specified actions on that line. awk continues to process input lines in this way until it reaches the end of the input files. 

**Awk** breaks each line of input passed to it into fields. By default, a field is a string of consecutive characters delimited by whitespace (can be changed via –F ).
**Awk** parses and operates on each separate field. This makes it ideal for handling structured text files -- especially tables -- data organized into consistent chunks, such as rows and columns.

When you run **awk**, you specify an **awk program** that tells **awk** what to do. If no file specified **awk** will read from stdout
```bash
$ awk [options] 'program' input-file1 input-file2 …
$ awk [options] -f program-file input-file1 input-file2 …
```
The program consists of a series of rules. Each rule specifies one pattern to search for and one action to perform upon finding the pattern.
```bash
$ # expression, i.e., $1 == "li".
$ # search pattern is a regular expression, i.e. /foo|bar|baz/.
$ # actions – statement(s) to be performed. $ $ # several patterns and actions are possible in awk.
$ # Single quotes around program is to avoid shell not to interpret any of its special characters.
$ # pattern { action }

$ awk '
    expression or /search pattern1/ { action }
    expression or /search pattern2/ { action }
    ' inut-file

$ # BEGIN rule is executed once only, before the first input record is read. 
$ # END rule is executed once only, after all the input is read.

$ awk '
     BEGIN { action }
       expression or /pattern/  { action }
     END   { action }
' input-file
```
