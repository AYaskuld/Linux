## Conditions

In terms of conditions bash has:

- test command or square brackets [ ]
- extended testcommand [[ ]]
- double parentheses (( )) and let command
- if/then construct
- case statements
- list constructs

### Test command

**[** (left bracket special character) is a synonym for test, and a built-in for efficiency reasons.

This command considers its arguments as comparison expressions or file tests and returns an exit status corresponding to the result of the comparison (0 for true, 1 for false).

       test EXPRESSION

       [ EXPRESSION ]
```bash
$ ls
file.txt

$ test -f file.txt && echo "File exists"
File exists

$ [ -f file.txt ] && echo Indeed
Indeed

$ [ -f file1.txt ] || echo No such file
No such file
```
### Checking exist status of a command in a script:
```bahs
#!/bin/bash

...
ifup eth0
[ $? -ne 0 ] && rc=1
```

### Extended test command

With version 2.02, Bash introduced the **[[** ... **]]** extended test command, which performs comparisons in a manner more familiar to programmers from other languages.
Note that **[[** is a keyword, not a command. Bash sees [[ $a -lt $b ]] as a single element, which returns an exit status. Using the **[[** ... **]]** test construct, rather than **[** ... **]** can prevent many logic errors in scripts. For example, the &&, ||, <, and > operators work within a **[[** **]]** test, despite giving an error within a **[** **]** construct.
```bash
$ string_with_spaces='some spaces here'
$ if [[ -n $string_with_spaces ]]; then
    echo "The string is non-empty";
  fi

The string is non-empty
```
 
```bahs
$ if [ -n $string_with_spaces ]; then
> echo "The string is non-empty";
> fi

-bash: [: too many arguments
```
### Double parentheses

The **((** ... **))** and let ... constructs return an exit status, according to whether the arithmetic expressions they evaluate expand to a non-zero value.

If the value of the expression is non-zero, the return status is 0; otherwise the return status is 1.

These arithmetic-expansion constructs may therefore be used to perform arithmetic comparisons.
```bash
$ (( 0 && 1 ))
$ echo $?
1

$ var=-2 && (( var+=2 ))
$ echo $?
1
```
For arithmetic expressions see **man bash** "ARITHMETIC EVALUATION" section

### if/then

An **if/then** construct tests whether the exit status of a list of commands is 0 (since 0 means "success" by UNIX convention), and if so, executes one or more commands.

An **if** can test any command, not just conditions enclosed within brackets.

Syntax:
```bash
if [ condition1 ]; then
  command1
  command2
elif [ condition2 ]; then
  command4
  command5
else
  default-command
fi
```
Example (/etc/init.d/network):
```bash
...
rootfs=$(awk '{ if ($1 !~ /^[ \t]*#/ && $2 == "/" && $3 != "rootfs") { print $3; }}' /proc/mounts)
if [[ "$rootfs" == nfs* || "$rootopts" =~ _r?netdev ]] ; then
        exit 1
fi
...
if [ ! -d /proc/net/vlan ] && ! modprobe 8021q >/dev/null 2>&1 ; then
        net_log $"No 802.1Q VLAN support available in kernel."
fi
...
```
### case
```bash
case EXPRESSION in
  case1)
    command1;
    command2;
  ;;
  case2)
    command3
  ;;
  …
  caseN)
    commandM
  ;;
esac
```
Each case is an expression matching a pattern. Each clause must be terminated with ";;". Each case statement is ended with the **esac** statement.

Init script example:
```bash
case "$1" in
        start)
            start
            ;;

        stop)
            stop
            ;;
        condrestart)
            if test "x`pidof anacron`" != x; then
                stop
                start
            fi
            ;;
        *)
            echo $"Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart|condrestart|status}"
            exit 1
esac
```
Bash script with arguments example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

MESSAGE=""
COUNT=5

help() {
  echo -e "\nUsage: $0 [OPTION]";
  echo "";
  echo -e "\t-m\tmessage to print"
  echo -e "\t-n\tnumber of messages to print. Default 5"
  echo -e "\t-h\tget help"
}

[[ -z "$@" ]] && help && exit 1;

for arg in "$@"; do
  case $arg in
    -m) MESSAGE=$2;
      shift;
      shift;
      ;;
    -n) COUNT=$2;
      shift;
      shift;
      ;;
    -h) help; exit 0;
      ;;
  esac
done

for i in $(seq 1 $COUNT); do
  echo $MESSAGE;
done
```
```bash
$ ./args.sh 
Usage: ./args.sh [OPTION]
    -m    message to print
    -n    number of messages to print. Default 5
    -h    get help

$ ./args.sh -m Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello

$ ./args.sh -m Hi -n 1
Hi
```
### List constructs

The "**and list**" and "**or list**" constructs provide a means of processing a number of commands consecutively. 

These can effectively replace complex nested if/then or even case statements.

### AND list

Each command executes in turn, provided that the previous command has given a return value of true (zero). At the first false (non-zero) return, the command chain terminates (the first command returning false is the last one to execute).
```bash
$ command-1 && command-2 && command-3 && ... command-n
```
### OR list

Each command executes in turn for as long as the previous command returns false. At the first true return, the command chain terminates (the first command returning true is the last one to execute).
```bash
$ command-1 || command-2 || command-3 || ... command-n
```
