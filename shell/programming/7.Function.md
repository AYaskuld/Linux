## Functions

A function is a subroutine, a code block that implements a set of operations, a "black box" that performs a specified task. Wherever there is repetitive code, when a task repeats with only slight variations in procedure, then consider using a function.
```bash
function_name () {
  command...
}
```
Functions may process arguments passed to them and return an exit status to the script for further processing.
```bash
$ function_name $arg1 $arg2
```
The function refers to the passed arguments by position (as if they were positional parameters), that is, $1, $2, and so forth.
```bahs
$ print_args () {
  local var1=$1
  local var2=$2
  echo "first function argument is:" $var1
  echo "second function argument is:" $var2
}
```
```bahs
$ print_args /tmp hello
first function argument is: /tmp
second function argument is: hello 
```
### Exit status

Functions return a value, called an exit status. This is analogous to the exit status returned by a command. The exit status may be explicitly specified by a return statement, otherwise it is the exit status of the last command in the function (0 if successful, and a non-zero error code if not). This exit status may be used in the script by referencing it as $?.

### Return

Terminates a function. A return command optionally takes an integer argument, which is

returned to the calling script as the "exit status" of the function, and this exit status is assigned to the variable $?.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

retfunc() {
  echo "this is retfunc()"
  return 1
}

exitfunc() {
  echo "this is exitfunc()"
  exit 1
}

retfunc
echo "We are still here"

exitfunc
echo "We will never see this"
```
```bash
$ ./func.sh
this is retfunc()
We are still here
this is exitfunc()
```
