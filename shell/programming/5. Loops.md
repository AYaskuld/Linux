## Loops

### loops

A loop is a block of code that iterates a list of commands as long as the loop control condition is true.

- For 
- While
- Until

### For loop

During each pass through the loop, arg takes on the value of each successive variable in the list.
```bash
for arg in [list]; do
    command(s)...
done
```
Example:
```bash
for file in "$( find . -type l )"; do
    echo "$file"
done | sort
```
### While loop

This construct tests for a condition at the top of a loop, and keeps looping as long as that condition is true (returns a 0 exit status). In contrast to a for loop, a while loop finds use in situations where the number of loop repetitions is not known beforehand.
```bash
while [ condition ]; do
  command(s)...
done
```
Example:
```bash
LIMIT=10

while [ "$a" -le $LIMIT ] ; do
  echo -n "$a "
  let "a+=1"
done
```
### Until loop

This construct tests for a condition at the top of a loop, and keeps looping as long as that condition is false

(opposite of while loop).
```bash
until [ condition-is-true ] ; do
    command(s)â€¦
done
```
### Loop control

 - **break**: the break command terminates the loop (breaks out of it).

 - **continue**: the continue command causes a jump to the next iteration of the loop, skipping all the remaining commands in that particular loop cycle.
```bahs
$ for i in {1..5}; do
    echo $i
    [[ $i -eq 3 ]] && break
  done
1
2
3
```
