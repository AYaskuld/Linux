### What is journalctl?

- In modern Linux systems logging subsystem is implemented by systemd-journald. It's a system service that collects and stores logging data.

- It creates and maintains structured, indexed binary files called journals based on logging information that is received from a variety of sources.

- One of the impetuses behind the systemd journal is to centralize the management of logs regardless of where the messages are originating.

- journalctl is a utility to query and display the systemd journal data.
```bash
# journalctl -u httpd

To show only entries logged at the error level or above, you can type:
```bash
$ journalctl -p err –b –x
...
```
where:

-p means priority or log level

-b means since last boot

-x means to add explanatory help texts to log messages in the output where this is available. These short help texts will explain the context of an error or log event, possible solutions, as well as pointers to support forums, developer documentation, and any other relevant manuals

To show only entries for specified syslog identifier:
```bash
$ journalctl -t dockerd

```
To see messages logged within a specific time window, we can use the --since and --until options
```bash
$ journalctl --since "1 hour ago"
…
$ journalctl --since "2 days ago"
…
$ journalctl --since "2015-06-26 23:15:00" --until "2015-06-26 23:20:00"
…
```
- **/var/log/messages** – Contains global system messages, including the messages that are logged during system startup. There are several things that are logged in /var/log/messages including mail, cron, daemon, kern, auth, etc.
- **/var/log/secure** - Contains information related to authentication and authorization privileges. For example, sshd logs all the messages here, including unsuccessful login
